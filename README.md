# Adder

The aim of this test repo is to make a "machine" capable of binary addition and subtraction.

You need to build your "machine" out of your gates. You can do this using normal java, and once again using spring for practise.

So now you have made some of the pieces, but you need to work out how to put it together. 

Good luck,
Mark
