# Adder

The aim of this test repo is to make a "machine" capable of binary addition and subtraction.

You need to build your "machine" out of your gates. You can do this using normal java, and once again using spring for practise.

So now you have made some of the pieces, but you need to work out how to put it together. 

Make sure your main method sets up the pieces that are needed, but it does not get too complicated. 

If  a class is too complicated, make new classes and push some of the code into the new classes. This is what it is about, working out what goes where, and how each of the pieces need to communicate with each other. 

Moving the code around like this is one of the possible ways to refactor your code. 


Good luck,

Mark
